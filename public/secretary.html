        <p>In the view of changing educational patterns, every educational Institute should aim to develop its own
            teaching and Learning process/system. The British education system - Lord Macaulay Education System - that
            limits the literacy to clerical tasks is not good enough to withstand the global competition which the youth
            will be facing ahead in the career. This pattern does not make even a First class S.S.C. student capable of
            narrating a handful of specialties of his own town / state nor a Commerce Post Graduate capable of opening
            his own bank account. The same is true with the Technical or engineering students also. The current students
            are far away from the General Knowledge and General Awareness resulting into insensitivity towards social
            issues and moreover, making it difficult for the teachers and the counselors to even make them realize the
            same. This entire situation being thought over has aroused the need to revamp the Complete Education System
            in the country.</p>
        <p>Apart from following the regular education pattern defined by the constitution, every educational institution
            has to implement the process of adapting and widening the modern learning methodologies. Year on Year, the
            students should develop interest in professional knowledge and be made professionally capable to ensure a
            strong foundation in the Society. The numerous incidents that happen at various levels of the demography -
            the Local, National and the Global, have an impact over the spread of education and knowledge. Understanding
            this impact and the problems involved in them is the learning process and finding solutions to these
            problems means developing, laboratories for research… ! Developing such laboratories where the future of
            kids, their upbringing, the strengths of youth and their development, directing them towards development and
            contribution to the society is being brain stormed as it is the need of the time.</p>
        <p>The random discussions in a session would be nowhere with time. Therefore, it is necessary that any issue is
            scientifically researched and the findings and thoughts are articulated, recorded in for future revisits.
            Such thoughts are periodically - weekly, fortnightly monthly, quarterly or annually - being published and
            updated through repetition. Similar attempt is being thought of by Walchand Group of Educational Institutes
            and therefore, we are initiating a quarterly publication, on experimental grounds.</p>
        <p>This publication will address the issues regarding India, the future of Indians, conveying that along with
            self interest, we care for the interest for the society and enjoy the obligation to fulfill our duties
            towards the society. We believe, this publication will be successful in conveying the message of our
            „Walchand Group of Educational Institutes‟.</p>
