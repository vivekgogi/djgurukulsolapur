        <p>Towards the end of 19th Century in India, to confront the challenges posed by a new era with a view to pursue
            rejuvenation various movements were initiated. The year 1885 had a unique historical importance. It was
            during this time that religious, ethical, educational and cultural needs of the society were realized and
            thus in 1885 Shri Aillak Pannalal Digamber Jain Pathshala was established in Solapur City. Though the
            institution aimed at imparting religious education, it was backed up by a strong inspiration of promoting
            national exhortation and national welfare. And hence a broad vision and non-communal motto 'Shikshan Hach
            Dharma' meaning 'Education is Religion' was sculpted.</p>
        <p>The concept of 'Jain Gurukul' inceptionized by Param Pujya Gurudev Samantabhadra Maharaj revolutionized the
            educational aspect of the Jain community. Educational institutions were duly established chronologically in
            the following year, 1918- Karanja, 1934- Bahubali, 1940- Solapur.</p>
        <p>The Walchand Industrial Group was one of the few conglomerates of the country that brought glory to the
            pre-independent India by pioneering in industrialization. The founding father of the Walchand Family Late
            Seth Hirachand Nemchand Doshi also served as the Trustee of the instituion. Today measuring the expansion
            and excellence of this educational institution,the visionary perception of the pioneers cannot be
            overlooked.</p>
        <p>Gyana, Sheel, Prem Seva and Vyavastha ie Knowledge, Morality, Love, Service and Management are the blissful
            virtues on which the life of Gurukul is humbly based. </p>
        <p>The institution primarily thrives on patriotism, religious devotion and individual well being. Hence Jain
            Gurukul is not only a boon to the Jain community but it proved to be a pligrimage centre for the entire
            society </p>
        <p>Inspired by the visionary Param Pujya Gurudev the institution of Shri Digamber Jain Gurukul Prashala was
            established in 1940. In the same premises Boys Hostel for impoverished boys was established. Bearing in mind
            the social considerations, the technical wing was established in 1961. It was unique in its kind which
            imparted technical education throughout the city.</p>
        <p>Two new high schools in 1961 were started viz. 'Nutan Vidhalaya' at Asti in Solpaur District and' Deshbhushan
            Kulbhushan Vidyalaya' at Kunthalgiri in Osmanabad District.</p>
        <p>The school was basically provisioned for boys but with a genorous view of all round progress of the society,
            girls were eventually provided with admission.</p>
        <p>In the year 1975 a Junior College Wing was established in the same premises. An overall demand from the
            different strata of the society a pri-primary division was started in 2003 which was gradually extended with
            primary school in 2004.</p>
