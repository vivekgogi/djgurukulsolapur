        <p>Shriman Seth Hirachand Nemchand Doshi, in the Year 1885 contentedly established 'Shri Digambar Jain
            Pathshala' on a praiseworthy pedestal in the field of education, recognizing 'Education as Religion'. This
            institute was initiated with the blessings of Shri. Aillak Pannalal Muniji and thereafter identified as Shri
            Aillak Pannalal Digambar Jain Pathshala in 1910, and it continued to glorify spiritual values through
            religious education until the year 1940. Further, with the blessings of Pujya Gurudev 108 Samantbhadra
            Maharaj, 'Loukik Education' progressed from the year 1940. At the moment, it is recognized as Shri Digambar
            Jain Gurukul Prashala. The institute initiated vocational education in 1961, considering the need of time,
            in addition HSC Vocational education was initiated in 1975. The dream envisioned by Late Hon. Bhausaheb
            Gandhi, of initiating 'Balak Mandir and Primary School' was flourished by Hon. Dr. Ranjit Gandhi in the year
            2003-04.</p>
        <p>Shri Digambar Jain Gurukul Prashala & Jr. College adopted the aphorism of 'Uttam Sanskar represents
            Education' (Culture is Education) and incessantly strives for the all round student and teacher development.
            The institute achieved overarching educational, social and cultural objectives imparting quality education
            promoting admirable learning habits among the students and the society at large. The fleeting look of the
            institute is depicted as under;-</p>
        <p>The noteworthy efforts and achievements of the institute have been recognized by the society honouring the
            institute with the 'Ideal School Award' by Hon. Deputy Director of Education, Pune on 07/02/1993 during the

        <p>The institute is uniquely committed to the highest possible standards of probity and accountability,

            enjoys a soaring Annual Result of 100 of HSC Vocational for March 2014, whereas 98.70 for the SSC exams.
            Four students of
            the institute secured first & second rank/prize in their respective areas during the International Yoga
            Competition glorifying the institute. Kumari Apeksha Sawant has been selected for the National level 'Jump
            Rope' competition. Four students were chosen for the chess competition at Divisional Level. Fourteen
            students were selected for
            Presidential Award, fourteen students for Governer's award since 1996, bringing laurels to this institute.
            To infuse the significance of Charity, the institute has initiated 'Ek Muthi Dhanya Yojana' accumulating
            thousand kilos of food grains and contributed to the 'Pakhar Sankul' and 'Mangal Drusthibhavan' the
            crusaders of social welfare. Students have also secured prizes during different Drawing Competitions, where
            two students participated in International Drawing Competition held at Malaysia. The institute secured
            prizes at city and district level since 1995 as well as first prize for eleven times. Group Song competition
            is being arranged at the state level. Beyond the call of duty, teachers of our institute have published
            books and research articles. About 44 students have qualified MTS exam and 3 of them have been offered
            scholarship and few others for the meritorious achievement in the NMMS exam. Currently, 15 students appeared
            for the exam and nine of them are offered scholarship.</p>
        <p>The accomplishments exemplify the institute's civic duty emphasizing at individual, community, state,
            national and international altitude. The institute strives continuously to develop civilized, refined,
            cultured, educated & knowledgeable students to make competent and responsible citizens fulfilling social and
